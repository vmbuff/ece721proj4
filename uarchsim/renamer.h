	// Structure 7: Global Branch Mask (GBM)
	//
	// The Global Branch Mask (GBM) is a bit vector that keeps track of
	// all unresolved branches. A '1' bit corresponds to an unresolved
	// branch. The "branch ID" of the unresolved branch is its position
	// in the bit vector.
	//
	// The GBM serves two purposes:
	//
	// 1. It provides a means for allocating checkpoints to unresolved
	//    branches. There are as many checkpoints as there are bits in
	//    the GBM. If all bits in the GBM are '1', then there are no
	//    free bits, hence, no free checkpoints. On the other hand, if
	//    not all bits in the GBM are '1', then any of the '0' bits
	//    are free and the corresponding checkpoints are free.
	//    
	// 2. Each in-flight instruction needs to know which unresolved
	//    branches it depends on, i.e., which unresolved branches are
	//    logically before it in program order. This information
	//    makes it possible to squash instructions that are after a
	//    branch, in program order, and not instructions before the
	//    branch. This functionality will be implemented using
	//    branch masks, as was done in the MIPS R10000 processor.
	//    An instruction's initial branch mask is the value of the
	//    the GBM when the instruction is renamed.
	//
	// The simulator requires an efficient implementation of bit vectors,
	// for quick copying and manipulation of bit vectors. Therefore, you
	// must implement the GBM as type "uint64_t".
	// (#include <inttypes.h>, already at top of this file)
	// The "uint64_t" type contains 64 bits, therefore, the simulator
	// cannot support a processor configuration with more than 64
	// unresolved branches. The maximum number of unresolved branches
	// is configurable by the user of the simulator, and can range from
	// 1 to 64.

		bool 	 FL_head_phase;					// Checkpointed Free List phase bit of head pointer

	//    Requirement: 1 <= n_branches <= 64.
	// 4. The maximum number of active instructions (Active List size).
	//
	// Tips:
	//
	// Assert the number of physical registers > number logical registers.
	// Assert 1 <= n_branches <= 64.
	// Assert n_active > 0.
	// Then, allocate space for the primary data structures.
	// Then, initialize the data structures based on the knowledge
	// that the pipeline is intially empty (no in-flight instructions yet).

	// 2. branch_ID: This uniquely identifies the branch and the

	// Tips:

	//   mispredicted branch's bit is cleared in the restored GBM,
	//   since it is now resolved and its bit and checkpoint are freed.
	// * You don't have to worry about explicitly freeing the GBM bits
	//   and checkpoints of branches that are after the mispredicted
	//   branch in program order. The mere act of restoring the GBM
	//   from the checkpoint achieves this feat.
	// * Restore the RMT using the branch's checkpoint.
	// * Restore the Free List head pointer and its phase bit,
	//   using the branch's checkpoint.

	//   corresponding to the entry after the branch's entry.
	//   Hints:
	//   You can infer the restored tail pointer from the branch's
	//   AL_index. You can infer the restored phase bit, using
	//   the phase bit of the Active List head pointer, where
	//   the restored Active List tail pointer is with respect to
	//   the Active List head pointer, and the knowledge that the
	//   Active List can't be empty at this moment (because the
	//   mispredicted branch is still in the Active List).
	// * Do NOT set the branch misprediction bit in the Active List.
	//   (Doing so would cause a second, full squash when the branch
	//   reaches the head of the Active List. We don’t want or need
	//   that because we immediately recover within this function.)
